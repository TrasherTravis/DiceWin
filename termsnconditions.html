        <h2>What is provably fair on-chain gambling?</h2>
        <h3>Simply put, provably fair means that any bet outcome can be independently verified and that the house or
            other players have no means of tampering with the result.</h3>
        <h2>Is dice2.win provably fair?</h2>
        <h3>Yes. The whole gameplay is controlled by Ethereum Smart Contract that computes random numbers based on house
            inputs and blockchain data (block hashes). Any party can audit the contract as well as inspect any
            transaction to make sure that neither dice2.win nor malicious players are influencing the results.</h3>
        <h2>How are you different from the other gambling sites?</h2>
        <h3>Placing a bet on dice2.win has much lower transaction fee compared to competing houses âˆ’ this allows
            supporting bets as low as 0.01 ETH. Our games are very simple & easily understandable, just like tossing a
            coin or rolling a dice.
        </h3>
        <h3>And, of course, we have jackpot!</h3>
        <h2>Is there any catch? Explain how it works like I'm five.</h2>
        <h3>This is where we have to get a bit technical:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>dice2.win picks a secret random number and provides you with its hash.</li>
            <li>You send your bet in Ethereum transaction to our smart contract along with the hash from previous step.
            </li>
            <li>At this point dice2.win has already commited to a number,
                prior to you chosing an outcome.</li>
            <li>Once your transaction is confirmed by the network,
                the contract stores the hash and bet details.</li>
            <li>Our croupier bot "reveals"the number by sending a bet settling transaction. The contract accepts the
                transaction if and only if the hash of provided number is the same as the stored one.</li>
            <li>The contract mixes the number and block hash of the bet transaction to get a random number.</li>
            <li>The contract decides whether you won or lost and sends you the winning amount of Ether.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Can dice2.win tamper with the results? Nope,
            as the contract keeps track of secret number's hash, meaning the house cannot change the number after the
            bet has been accepted. Mixing the block hash with the numbers makes the result totally random yet disallows
            miners from crafting winning bets. On the other hand, dice2.win themselves cannot control bet outcomes
            either because of block hash component. This is a well-known "commitment scheme" which enables dice2.win to
            provide gambling-grade random number generation allowing for big bets, jackpots and quick settlements while
            being fully transparent.</h3>
        <h2>What if I want to really verify that everything you say is actually true?</h2>
        <h3>Feel free to study our Smart Contract - it's available on Github. In case you have any questions or
            hesitations, drop us a line via Telegram, Twitter or e-mail.</h3>
        <h2>What are house fees?</h2>
        <h3>Every bet is deducted 1% in favour of the house (to help us pay the bills and keep the game running) and 1%
            more gets accumulated in the jackpot. Anyone who bets high enough (at the moment it is 0.1 ETH and up) has a
            chance of winning the whole amount of jackpot!</h3>
